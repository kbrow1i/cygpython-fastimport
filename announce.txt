python-fastimport-0.9.2-1 has been added to the Cygwin distribution.

python-fastimport is the Python parser that was originally developed for bzr-fastimport but was extracted so that it can be used by other projects.  It is currently used by bzr-fastimport and dulwich. hg-fastimport and git-remote-hg use a slightly modified version of it.
